Firma ships with complete localization in 7 languages, making it ready for teams across Europe and Latin America from day one.

## Supported languages

| Language   | Code |
| ---------- | ---- |
| English    | `en` |
| Spanish    | `es` |
| Italian    | `it` |
| Portuguese | `pt` |
| French     | `fr` |
| German     | `de` |
| Greek      | `el` |

All UI elements — buttons, labels, notifications, emails, and error messages — are fully translated in each language.

## How language detection works

Firma uses a 3-tier fallback system to select the right language for each user:

### 1. User preference (highest priority)

If a user has previously selected a language, that preference is saved to their account in the database and used across all sessions and devices.

### 2. Local storage

On return visits, Firma checks the browser's local storage for a cached language preference. This provides instant language selection without a network request.

### 3. Browser detection (default)

On a user's first visit, Firma automatically matches the language to their browser or system language setting. If the detected language isn't one of the 7 supported languages, Firma defaults to English.

## URL-based language override

You can force a specific language by appending the `lang` query parameter to any Firma URL:

```
https://app.firma.dev/signing/{signing_request_user_id}?lang=es
```

This is useful when you want to:

- Link directly into Firma in the correct locale for your users
- Pre-select the language in embedded iframes
- Test the signing experience in different languages

### Supported values

Use the two-letter language codes from the table above: `en`, `es`, `it`, `pt`, `fr`, `de`, `el`.

### Example: Embed signing in Spanish

```html
<iframe
  src="https://app.firma.dev/signing/{signing_request_user_id}?lang=es"
  style="width:100%;height:900px;border:0;"
  allow="camera;microphone;clipboard-write"
  title="Firmar Documento"
></iframe>
```

## Per-user persistence

When a user changes their language in Firma, the preference is:

- **Saved to the database** on their account, tied to their active company membership
- **Synced across sessions** — switching devices or browsers preserves their choice
- **Multi-tenant aware** — language preferences are scoped per company membership, so a user can have different language settings across different organizations

## Localization in embeddable components

Firma's embeddable components fully support localization:

- **[Embeddable signing](embeddable-signing)** — The signing interface renders in the detected or overridden language
- **[Embeddable template editor](embeddable-template-editor)** — Template creation and editing UI is fully localized
- **[Embeddable signing request editor](embeddable-signing-request-editor)** — The signing request configuration interface supports all 7 languages

### Non-persistent mode for iframes

When Firma is embedded in an iframe, language preferences operate in a non-persistent mode. This means the language is determined by:

1. The `lang` URL parameter (if provided)
2. The parent page's context

This prevents embedded Firma components from overwriting language settings in the host application. Use the `lang` query parameter to control the language explicitly in iframe contexts.

### Example: Dynamic language selection

```js
function embedSigning(signingRequestUserId, locale) {
  const iframe = document.createElement('iframe')
  iframe.src = `https://app.firma.dev/signing/${signingRequestUserId}?lang=${locale}`
  iframe.style.cssText = 'width:100%;height:900px;border:0;'
  iframe.allow = 'camera;microphone;clipboard-write'
  iframe.title = 'Sign Document'
  document.getElementById('signing-container').appendChild(iframe)
}

// Use the locale from your application
embedSigning('user_123', 'fr')
```

## Best practices

- **Use the `lang` parameter in embeds** — Don't rely on browser detection in iframe contexts. Pass the language explicitly to ensure a consistent experience.
- **Match your application's locale** — When embedding Firma, pass the same locale your application is using so the signing experience feels seamless.
- **Let users choose** — For direct Firma links (e.g., in emails), omit the `lang` parameter and let Firma's automatic detection handle it. Users who have set a preference will see their chosen language.
