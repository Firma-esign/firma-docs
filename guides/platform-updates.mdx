### Embedded Editor Close Controls

Both the **Template Editor** and **Signing Request Editor** now support a built-in close button and programmatic close, giving you full control over the editor lifecycle within your application.

- **Close button** — Enable `showCloseButton` to display a close button in the editor header. When clicked, your `onClose` callback receives `{ hasUnsavedChanges: boolean }` so you can prompt users to save before navigating away.
- **Programmatic close** — Call `triggerClose()` on the editor instance to close it from your own UI (e.g., a navigation event or "back" button). It checks for unsaved changes automatically.

These options are available on both `FirmaTemplateEditor` and `FirmaSigningRequestEditor`. See the [embeddable template editor](embeddable-template-editor) and [embeddable signing request editor](embeddable-signing-request-editor) guides for full details.

### Multi-Script Signature Support

Firma now supports 5 international writing systems for typed signatures with automatic script detection and curated signature fonts.

**Supported scripts:**

| Script | Languages | Signature Font |
|--------|-----------|----------------|
| Latin/Western | English, Spanish, French, German, Portuguese, Italian, Polish, Czech | Default signature fonts |
| Cyrillic | Russian, Ukrainian, Bulgarian, Serbian | Marck Script |
| Greek | Greek (including accented characters like ά, έ, ί, ό) | Zen Kurenaido |
| Japanese | Hiragana, Katakana, Kanji | Zen Kurenaido |
| Korean | Hangul | Nanum Pen Script |

Each script family includes multiple signature style options with hand-picked fonts. The system automatically detects the signer's script based on their typed name, though signers can manually switch if needed.

All signatures render correctly in completion certificates and final PDFs.

### Greek Language Support

The Firma interface is now fully available in Greek, bringing the total to 7 supported languages:

- English
- Spanish
- Portuguese
- French
- Italian
- German
- **Greek** (new)
